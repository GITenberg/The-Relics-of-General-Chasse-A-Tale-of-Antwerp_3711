<h1>THE RELICS OF GENERAL CHASS&Eacute;<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A TALE OF ANTWERP.</span></h1>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> Belgium is now one of the
European kingdoms, living by its own laws, resting on its own
bottom, with a king and court, palaces and parliament of its own,
is known to all the world.&nbsp; And a very nice little kingdom
it is; full of old towns, fine Flemish pictures, and interesting
Gothic churches.&nbsp; But in the memory of very many of us who
do not think ourselves old men, Belgium, as it is now
called&mdash;in those days it used to be Flanders and
Brabant&mdash;was a part of Holland; and it obtained its own
independence by a revolution.&nbsp; In that revolution the most
important military step was the siege of Antwerp, which was
defended on the part of the Dutch by General Chass&eacute;, with
the utmost gallantry, but nevertheless ineffectually.</p>
<p>After the siege Antwerp became quite a show place; and among
the visitors who flocked there to talk of the gallant general,
and to see what remained of the great effort which he had made to
defend the place, were two Englishmen.&nbsp; One was the hero of
this little history; and the other was a young man of
considerably less weight in the world.&nbsp; The less I say of
the latter the better; but it is necessary that I should give
some description of the former.</p>
<p>The Rev. Augustus Horne was, at the time of my narrative, a
beneficed clergyman of the Church of England.&nbsp; The
profession which he had graced sat easily on him.&nbsp; Its
external marks and signs were as pleasing to his friends as were
its internal comforts to himself.&nbsp; He was a man of much
quiet mirth, full of polished wit, and on some rare occasions he
could descend to the more noisy hilarity of a joke.&nbsp; Loved
by his friends he loved all the world.&nbsp; He had known no care
and seen no sorrow.&nbsp; Always intended for holy orders he had
entered them without a scruple, and remained within their pale
without a regret.&nbsp; At twenty-four he had been a deacon, at
twenty-seven a priest, at thirty a rector, and at thirty-five a
prebendary; and as his rectory was rich and his prebendal stall
well paid, the Rev. Augustus Horne was called by all, and called
himself, a happy man.&nbsp; His stature was about six feet two,
and his corpulence exceeded even those bounds which symmetry
would have preferred as being most perfectly compatible even with
such a height.&nbsp; But nevertheless Mr. Horne was a well-made
man; his hands and feet were small; his face was handsome, frank,
and full of expression; his bright eyes twinkled with humour; his
finely-cut mouth disclosed two marvellous rows of well-preserved
ivory; and his slightly aquiline nose was just such a projection
as one would wish to see on the face of a well-fed good-natured
dignitary of the Church of England.&nbsp; When I add to all this
that the reverend gentleman was as generous as he was
rich&mdash;and the kind mother in whose arms he had been nurtured
had taken care that he should never want&mdash;I need hardly say
that I was blessed with a very pleasant travelling companion.</p>
<p>I must mention one more interesting particular. Mr. Horne was
rather inclined to dandyism, in an innocent way.&nbsp; His
clerical starched neckcloth was always of the whitest, his
cambric handkerchief of the finest, his bands adorned with the
broadest border; his sable suit never degenerated to a rusty
brown; it not only gave on all occasions glossy evidence of
freshness, but also of the talent which the artisan had displayed
in turning out a well-dressed clergyman of the Church of
England.&nbsp; His hair was ever brushed with scrupulous
attention, and showed in its regular waves the guardian care of
each separate bristle.&nbsp; And all this was done with that ease
and grace which should be the characteristics of a dignitary of
the established English Church.</p>
<p>I had accompanied Mr. Horne to the Rhine; and we had reached
Brussels on our return, just at the close of that revolution
which ended in affording a throne to the son-in-law of George the
Fourth.&nbsp; At that moment General Chass&eacute;&rsquo;s name
and fame were in every man&rsquo;s mouth, and, like other curious
admirers of the brave, Mr. Horne determined to devote two days to
the scene of the late events at Antwerp.&nbsp; Antwerp, moreover,
possesses perhaps the finest spire, and certainly one of the
three or four finest pictures, in the world.&nbsp; Of General
Chass&eacute;, of the cathedral, and of the Rubens, I had heard
much, and was therefore well pleased that such should be his
resolution.&nbsp; This accomplished we were to return to
Brussels; and thence, via Ghent, Ostend, and Dover, I to complete
my legal studies in London, and Mr. Horne to enjoy once more the
peaceful retirement of Ollerton rectory.&nbsp; As we were to be
absent from Brussels but one night we were enabled to indulge in
the gratification of travelling without our luggage.&nbsp; A
small sac-de-nuit was prepared; brushes, combs, razors, strops, a
change of linen, &amp;c. &amp;c., were carefully put up; but our
heavy baggage, our coats, waistcoats, and other wearing apparel
were unnecessary.&nbsp; It was delightful to feel oneself so
light-handed.&nbsp; The reverend gentleman, with my humble self
by his side, left the portal of the H&ocirc;tel de Belle Vue at 7
a.m., in good humour with all the world.&nbsp; There were no
railroads in those days; but a cabriolet, big enough to hold six
persons, with rope traces and corresponding appendages, deposited
us at the Golden Fleece in something less than six hours.&nbsp;
The inward man was duly fortified, and we started for the
castle.</p>
<p>It boots not here to describe the effects which gunpowder and
grape-shot had had on the walls of Antwerp.&nbsp; Let the curious
in these matters read the horrors of the siege of Troy, or the
history of Jerusalem taken by Titus.&nbsp; The one may be found
in Homer, and the other in Josephus.&nbsp; Or if they prefer
doings of a later date there is the taking of Sebastopol, as
narrated in the columns of the &ldquo;Times&rdquo;
newspaper.&nbsp; The accounts are equally true, instructive, and
intelligible.&nbsp; In the mean time allow the Rev. Augustus
Horne and myself to enter the private chambers of the renowned
though defeated general.</p>
<p>We rambled for a while through the covered way, over the
glacis and along the counterscarp, and listened to the guide as
he detailed to us, in already accustomed words, how the siege had
gone.&nbsp; Then we got into the private apartments of the
general, and, having dexterously shaken off our attendant,
wandered at large among the deserted rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is clear that no one ever comes here,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Rev. Augustus; &ldquo;it seems not;
and to tell the truth, I don&rsquo;t know why any one should
come.&nbsp; The chambers in themselves are not
attractive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What he said was true.&nbsp; They were plain, ugly, square,
unfurnished rooms, here a big one, and there a little one, as is
usual in most houses;&mdash;unfurnished, that is, for the most
part.&nbsp; In one place we did find a table and a few chairs, in
another a bedstead, and so on.&nbsp; But to me it was pleasant to
indulge in those ruminations which any traces of the great or
unfortunate create in softly sympathising minds.&nbsp; For a time
we communicated our thoughts to each other as we roamed free as
air through the apartments; and then I lingered for a few moments
behind, while Mr. Horne moved on with a quicker step.</p>
<p>At last I entered the bedchamber of the general, and there I
overtook my friend.&nbsp; He was inspecting, with much attention,
an article of the great man&rsquo;s wardrobe which he held in his
hand.&nbsp; It was precisely that virile habiliment to which a
well-known gallant captain alludes in his conversation with the
posthumous appearance of Miss Bailey, as containing a Bank of
England &pound;5 note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general must have been a large man, George, or he
would hardly have filled these,&rdquo; said Mr. Horne, holding up
to the light the respectable leathern articles in question.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He must have been a very large man,&mdash;the largest man
in Antwerp, I should think; or else his tailor has done him more
than justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were certainly large, and had about them a charming
regimental military appearance.&nbsp; They were made of white
leather, with bright metal buttons at the knees and bright metal
buttons at the top.&nbsp; They owned no pockets, and were, with
the exception of the legitimate outlet, continuous in the
circumference of the waistband.&nbsp; No dangling strings gave
them an appearance of senile imbecility.&nbsp; Were it not for a
certain rigidity, sternness, and mental inflexibility,&mdash;we
will call it military ardour,&mdash;with which they were imbued,
they would have created envy in the bosom of a fox-hunter.</p>
<p>Mr. Horne was no fox-hunter, but still he seemed to be
irresistibly taken with the lady-like propensity of wishing to
wear them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely, George,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;the general must have been a stouter man than I
am&rdquo;&mdash;and he contemplated his own proportions with
complacency&mdash;&ldquo;these what&rsquo;s-the-names are quite
big enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I differed in opinion, and was obliged to explain that I
thought he did the good living of Ollerton insufficient
justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure they are large enough for me,&rdquo; he
repeated, with considerable obstinacy.&nbsp; I smiled
incredulously; and then to settle the matter he resolved that he
would try them on.&nbsp; Nobody had been in these rooms for the
last hour, and it appeared as though they were never
visited.&nbsp; Even the guide had not come on with us, but was
employed in showing other parties about the fortifications.&nbsp;
It was clear that this portion of the building was left desolate,
and that the experiment might be safely made.&nbsp; So the
sportive rector declared that he would for a short time wear the
regimentals which had once contained the valorous heart of
General Chass&eacute;.</p>
<p>With all decorum the Rev. Mr. Horne divested himself of the
work of the London artist&rsquo;s needle, and, carefully placing
his own garments beyond the reach of dust, essayed to fit himself
in military garb.</p>
<p>At that important moment&mdash;at the critical instant of the
attempt&mdash;the clatter of female voices was heard approaching
the chamber.&nbsp; They must have suddenly come round some
passage corner, for it was evident by the sound that they were
close upon us before we had any warning of their advent.&nbsp; At
this very minute Mr. Horne was somewhat embarrassed in his
attempts, and was not fully in possession of his usual active
powers of movement, nor of his usual presence of mind.&nbsp; He
only looked for escape; and seeing a door partly open, he with
difficulty retreated through it, and I followed him.&nbsp; We
found that we were in a small dressing-room; and as by good luck
the door was defended by an inner bolt, my friend was able to
protect himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There shall be another siege, at any rate as stout as
the last, before I surrender,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>As the ladies seemed inclined to linger in the room it became
a matter of importance that the above-named articles should fit,
not only for ornament but for use.&nbsp; It was very cold, and
Mr. Horne was altogether unused to move in a Highland sphere of
life.&nbsp; But alas, alas!&nbsp; General Chass&eacute; had not
been nurtured in the classical retirement of Ollerton.&nbsp; The
ungiving leather would stretch no point to accommodate the
divine, though it had been willing to minister to the convenience
of the soldier.&nbsp; Mr. Horne was vexed and chilled; and
throwing the now hateful garments into a corner, and protecting
himself from the cold as best he might by standing with his knees
together and his body somewhat bent so as to give the skirts of
his coat an opportunity of doing extra duty, he begged me to see
if those jabbering females were not going to leave him in peace
to recover his own property.&nbsp; I accordingly went to the
door, and opening it to a small extent I peeped through.</p>
<p>Who shall describe my horror at the sight which I then
saw?&nbsp; The scene, which had hitherto been tinted with comic
effect, was now becoming so decidedly tragic that I did not dare
at once to acquaint my worthy pastor with that which was
occurring,&mdash;and, alas! had already occurred.</p>
<p>Five country-women of our own&mdash;it was easy to know them
by their dress and general aspect&mdash;were standing in the
middle of the room; and one of them, the centre of the group, the
senior harpy of the lot, a maiden lady&mdash;I could have sworn
to that&mdash;with a red nose, held in one hand a huge pair of
scissors, and in the other&mdash;the already devoted goods of my
most unfortunate companion!&nbsp; Down from the waistband,
through that goodly expanse, a fell gash had already gone through
and through; and in useless, unbecoming disorder the broadcloth
fell pendant from her arm on this side and on that.&nbsp; At that
moment I confess that I had not the courage to speak to Mr.
Horne,&mdash;not even to look at him.</p>
<p>I must describe that group.&nbsp; Of the figure next to me I
could only see the back.&nbsp; It was a broad back done up in
black silk not of the newest.&nbsp; The whole figure, one may
say, was dumpy.&nbsp; The black silk was not long, as dresses now
are worn, nor wide in its skirts.&nbsp; In every way it was
skimpy, considering the breadth it had to cover; and below the
silk I saw the heels of two thick shoes, and enough to swear by
of two woollen stockings.&nbsp; Above the silk was a red and blue
shawl; and above that a ponderous, elaborate brown bonnet, as to
the materials of which I should not wish to undergo an
examination.&nbsp; Over and beyond this I could only see the
backs of her two hands.&nbsp; They were held up as though in
wonder at that which the red-nosed holder of the scissors had
dared to do.</p>
<p>Opposite to this lady, and with her face fully tamed to me,
was a kindly-looking, fat motherly woman, with light-coloured
hair, not in the best order.&nbsp; She was hot and scarlet with
exercise, being perhaps too stout for the steep steps of the
fortress; and in one hand she held a handkerchief, with which
from time to time she wiped her brow.&nbsp; In the other hand she
held one of the extremities of my friend&rsquo;s property,
feeling&mdash;good, careful soul!&mdash;what was the texture of
the cloth.&nbsp; As she did so, I could see a glance of
approbation pass across her warm features.&nbsp; I liked that
lady&rsquo;s face, in spite of her untidy hair, and felt that had
she been alone my friend would not have been injured.</p>
<p>On either side of her there stood a flaxen-haired maiden, with
long curls, large blue eyes, fresh red cheeks, an undefined lumpy
nose, and large good-humoured mouth.&nbsp; They were as like as
two peas, only that one was half an inch taller than the other;
and there was no difficulty in discovering, at a moment&rsquo;s
glance, that they were the children of that over-heated matron
who was feeling the web of my friend&rsquo;s cloth.</p>
<p>But the principal figure was she who held the centre place in
the group.&nbsp; She was tall and thin, with fierce-looking eyes,
rendered more fierce by the spectacles which she wore; with a red
nose as I said before; and about her an undescribable something
which quite convinced me that she had never known&mdash;could
never know&mdash;aught of the comforts of married life.&nbsp; It
was she who held the scissors and the black garments.&nbsp; It
was she who had given that unkind cut.&nbsp; As I looked at her
she whisked herself quickly round from one companion to the
other, triumphing in what she had done, and ready to triumph
further in what she was about to do.&nbsp; I immediately
conceived a deep hatred for that Queen of the Harpies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose they can&rsquo;t be wanted
again,&rdquo; said the mother, rubbing her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear no!&rdquo; said she of the red nose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are relics!&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought to leap forth; but
for what purpose should I have leaped?&nbsp; The accursed
scissors had already done their work; and the symmetry, nay, even
the utility of the vestment was destroyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Chass&eacute; wore a very good article;&mdash;I
will say that for him,&rdquo; continued the mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he did!&rdquo; said the Queen Harpy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why should he not, seeing that the country paid for it for
him?&nbsp; Well, ladies, who&rsquo;s for having a bit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my! you won&rsquo;t go for to cut them up,&rdquo;
said the stout back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t I,&rdquo; said the scissors; and she
immediately made another incision.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s for
having a bit?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t all speak at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like a morsel for a pincushion,&rdquo; said
flaxen-haired Miss No. 1, a young lady about nineteen, actuated
by a general affection for all sword-bearing, fire-eating
heroes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should like to have something to make me
think of the poor general!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snip, snip went the scissors with professional rapidity, and a
round piece was extracted from the back of the calf of the left
leg.&nbsp; I shuddered with horror; and so did the Rev. Augustus
Horne with cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think it&rsquo;s proper to cut them up,&rdquo;
said Miss No. 2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said the harpy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll do what&rsquo;s improper!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
she got her finger and thumb well through the holes in the
scissors&rsquo; handles.&nbsp; As she spoke resolution was
plainly marked on her brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if they are to be cut up, I should certainly like
a bit for a pen-wiper,&rdquo; said No. 2.&nbsp; No. 2 was a
literary young lady with a periodical correspondence, a journal,
and an album.&nbsp; Snip, snip went the scissors again, and the
broad part of the upper right division afforded ample materials
for a pen-wiper.</p>
<p>Then the lady with the back, seeing that the desecration of
the article had been completed, plucked up heart of courage and
put in her little request; &ldquo;I think I might have a
needle-case out of it,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;just as a suvneer
of the poor general&rdquo;&mdash;and a long fragment cut rapidly
out of the waistband afforded her unqualified delight.</p>
<p>Mamma, with the hot face and untidy hair, came next.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, girls,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as you are all
served, I don&rsquo;t see why I&rsquo;m to be left out.&nbsp;
Perhaps, Miss Grogram&rdquo;&mdash;she was an old maid, you
see&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps, Miss Grogram, you could get me as much
as would make a decent-sized reticule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not the slightest difficulty in doing this.&nbsp;
The harpy in the centre again went to work, snip, snip, and
extracting from that portion of the affairs which usually
sustained the greater portion of Mr. Horne&rsquo;s weight two
large round pieces of cloth, presented them to the well-pleased
matron.&nbsp; &ldquo;The general knew well where to get a bit of
good broadcloth, certainly,&rdquo; said she, again feeling the
pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for No. 1,&rdquo; said she whom I so absolutely
hated; &ldquo;I think there is still enough for a pair of
slippers.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing so nice for the house as
good black cloth slippers that are warm to the feet and
don&rsquo;t show the dirt.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so saying, she spread
out on the floor the lacerated remainders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a nice bit there,&rdquo; said young lady
No. 2, poking at one of the pockets with the end of her
parasol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the harpy, contemplating her
plunder.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m thinking whether I
couldn&rsquo;t get leggings as well.&nbsp; I always wear leggings
in the thick of the winter.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so she concluded her
operations, and there was nothing left but a melancholy skeleton
of seams and buttons.</p>
<p>All this having been achieved, they pocketed their plunder and
prepared to depart.&nbsp; There are people who have a wonderful
appetite for relics.&nbsp; A stone with which Washington had
broken a window when a boy&mdash;with which he had done so or had
not, for there is little difference; a button that was on a coat
of Napoleon&rsquo;s, or on that of one of his lackeys; a bullet
said to have been picked up at Waterloo or Bunker&rsquo;s Hill;
these, and suchlike things are great treasures.&nbsp; And their
most desirable characteristic is the ease with which they are
attained.&nbsp; Any bullet or any button does the work.&nbsp;
Faith alone is necessary.&nbsp; And now these ladies had made
themselves happy and glorious with &ldquo;Relics&rdquo; of
General Chass&eacute; cut from the ill-used habiliments of an
elderly English gentleman!</p>
<p>They departed at last, and Mr. Horne, for once in an ill
humour, followed me into the bedroom.&nbsp; Here I must be
excused if I draw a veil over his manly sorrow at discovering
what fate had done for him.&nbsp; Remember what was his position,
unclothed in the Castle of Antwerp!&nbsp; The nearest suitable
change for those which had been destroyed was locked up in his
portmanteau at the H&ocirc;tel de Belle Rue in Brussels!&nbsp; He
had nothing left to him&mdash;literally nothing, in that Antwerp
world.&nbsp; There was no other wretched being wandering then in
that Dutch town so utterly denuded of the goods of life.&nbsp;
For what is a man fit,&mdash;for what can he be fit,&mdash;when
left in such a position?&nbsp; There are some evils which seem
utterly to crush a man; and if there be any misfortune to which a
man may be allowed to succumb without imputation on his
manliness, surely it is such as this.&nbsp; How was Mr. Horne to
return to his hotel without incurring the displeasure of the
municipality?&nbsp; That was my first thought.</p>
<p>He had a cloak, but it was at the inn; and I found that my
friend was oppressed with a great horror at the idea of being
left alone; so that I could not go in search of it.&nbsp; There
is an old saying, that no man is a hero to his valet de chambre,
the reason doubtless being this, that it is customary for his
valet to see the hero divested of those trappings in which so
much of the heroic consists.&nbsp; Who reverences a clergyman
without his gown, or a warrior without his sword and
sabre-tasche?&nbsp; What would even Minerva be without her
helmet?</p>
<p>I do not wish it to be understood that I no longer reverenced
Mr. Horne because he was in an undress; but he himself certainly
lost much of his composed, well-sustained dignity of
demeanour.&nbsp; He was fearful and querulous, cold, and rather
cross.&nbsp; When, forgetting his size, I offered him my own, he
thought that I was laughing at him.&nbsp; He began to be afraid
that the story would get abroad, and he then and there exacted a
promise that I would never tell it during his lifetime.&nbsp; I
have kept my word; but now my old friend has been gathered to his
fathers, full of years.</p>
<p>At last I got him to the hotel.&nbsp; It was long before he
would leave the castle, cloaked though he was;&mdash;not, indeed,
till the shades of evening had dimmed the outlines of men and
things, and made indistinct the outward garniture of those who
passed to and fro in the streets.&nbsp; Then, wrapped in his
cloak, Mr. Horne followed me along the quays and through the
narrowest of the streets; and at length, without venturing to
return the gaze of any one in the hotel court, he made his way up
to his own bedroom.</p>
<p>Dinnerless and supperless he went to his couch.&nbsp; But when
there he did consent to receive some consolation in the shape of
mutton cutlets and fried potatoes, a savory omelet, and a bottle
of claret.&nbsp; The mutton cutlets and fried potatoes at the
Golden Fleece at Antwerp are&mdash;or were then, for I am
speaking now of well-nigh thirty years since&mdash;remarkably
good; the claret, also, was of the best; and so, by degrees, the
look of despairing dismay passed from his face, and some
scintillations of the old fire returned to his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether they find themselves much happier for
what they have got?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal happier,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll boast of those things to all their friends
at home, and we shall doubtless see some account of their success
in the newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be delightful to expose their
blunder,&mdash;to show them up.&nbsp; Would it not, George?&nbsp;
To turn the tables on them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I should like to have the
laugh against them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I, only that I should compromise myself by
telling the story.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t do at all to have it
told at Oxford with my name attached to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this also I assented.&nbsp; To what would I not have
assented in my anxiety to make him happy after his misery?</p>
<p>But all was not over yet.&nbsp; He was in bed now, but it was
necessary that he should rise again on the morrow.&nbsp; At home,
in England, what was required might perhaps have been made during
the night; but here, among the slow Flemings, any such exertion
would have been impossible.&nbsp; Mr. Horne, moreover, had no
desire to be troubled in his retirement by a tailor.</p>
<p>Now the landlord of the Golden Fleece was a very stout
man,&mdash;a very stout man indeed.&nbsp; Looking at him as he
stood with his hands in his pockets at the portal of his own
establishment, I could not but think that he was stouter even
than Mr. Horne.&nbsp; But then he was certainly much shorter, and
the want of due proportion probably added to his unwieldy
appearance.&nbsp; I walked round him once or twice wishfully,
measuring him in my eye, and thinking of what texture might be
the Sunday best of such a man.&nbsp; The clothes which he then
had on were certainly not exactly suited to Mr. Horne&rsquo;s
tastes.</p>
<p>He saw that I was observing him, and appeared uneasy and
offended.&nbsp; I had already ascertained that he spoke a little
English.&nbsp; Of Flemish I knew literally nothing, and in
French, with which probably he was also acquainted, I was by no
means voluble.&nbsp; The business which I had to transact was
intricate, and I required the use of my mother-tongue.</p>
<p>It was intricate and delicate, and difficult withal.&nbsp; I
began by remarking on the weather, but he did not take my remarks
kindly.&nbsp; I am inclined to fancy that he thought I was
desirous of borrowing money from him.&nbsp; At any rate he gave
me no encouragement in my first advances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vat misfortune?&rdquo; at last he asked, when I had
succeeded in making him understand that a gentleman up stairs
required his assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has lost these things,&rdquo; and I took hold of my
own garments.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story, or I&rsquo;d
tell you how; but he has not a pair in the world till he gets
back to Brussels,&mdash;unless you can lend him one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost hees br-?&rdquo; and he opened his eyes wide, and
looked at me with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, exactly so,&rdquo; said I, interrupting
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most astonishing thing, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp;
But it&rsquo;s quite true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vas hees money in de pocket?&rdquo; asked my auspicious
landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not so bad as that, his
money is all right.&nbsp; I had the money, luckily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! dat is better.&nbsp; But he have lost hees
b-?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes;&rdquo; I was now getting rather
impatient.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no mistake about it.&nbsp; He
has lost them as sure as you stand there.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then I
proceeded to explain that as the gentleman in question was very
stout, and as he, the landlord, was stoat also, he might assist
us in this great calamity by a loan from his own wardrobe.</p>
<p>When he found that the money was not in the pocket, and that
his bill therefore would be paid, he was not indisposed to be
gracious.&nbsp; He would, he said, desire his servant to take up
what was required to Mr. Horne&rsquo;s chamber.&nbsp; I
endeavoured to make him understand that a sombre colour would be
preferable; but he only answered that he would put the best that
he had at the gentleman&rsquo;s disposal.&nbsp; He could not
think of offering anything less than his best on such an
occasion.&nbsp; And then he turned his back and went his way,
muttering as he went something in Flemish, which I believed to be
an exclamation of astonishment that any man should, under any
circumstances, lose such an article.</p>
<p>It was now getting late; so when I had taken a short stroll by
myself, I went to bed without disturbing Mr. Horne again that
night.&nbsp; On the following morning I thought it best not to go
to him unless he sent for me; so I desired the boots to let him
know that I had ordered breakfast in a private room, and that I
would await him there unless he wished to see me.&nbsp; He sent
me word back to say that he would be with me very shortly.</p>
<p>He did not keep me waiting above half an hour, but I confess
that that half hour was not pleasantly spent.&nbsp; I feared that
his temper would be tried in dressing, and that he would not be
able to eat his breakfast in a happy state of mind.&nbsp; So that
when I heard his heavy footstep advancing along the passage my
heart did misgive me, and I felt that I was trembling.</p>
<p>That step was certainly slower and more ponderous than
usual.&nbsp; There was always a certain dignity in the very sound
of his movements, but now this seemed to have been
enhanced.&nbsp; To judge merely by the step one would have said
that a bishop was coming that way instead of a prebendary.</p>
<p>And then he entered.&nbsp; In the upper half of his august
person no alteration was perceptible.&nbsp; The hair was as
regular and as graceful as ever, the handkerchief as white, the
coat as immaculate; but below his well-filled waistcoat a pair of
red plush began to shine in unmitigated splendour, and continued
from thence down to within an inch above his knee; nor, as it
appeared, could any pulling induce them to descend lower.&nbsp;
Mr. Horne always wore black silk stockings,&mdash;at least so the
world supposed, but it was now apparent that the world had been
wrong in presuming him to be guilty of such extravagance.&nbsp;
Those, at any rate, which he exhibited on the present occasion
were more economical.&nbsp; They were silk to the calf, but
thence upwards they continued their career in white cotton.&nbsp;
These then followed the plush; first two snowy, full-sized
pillars of white, and then two jet columns of flossy silk.&nbsp;
Such was the appearance, on that well-remembered morning, of the
Rev. Augustus Horne, as he entered the room in which his
breakfast was prepared.</p>
<p>I could see at a glance that a dark frown contracted his
eyebrows, and that the compressed muscles of his upper lip gave a
strange degree of austerity to his open face.&nbsp; He carried
his head proudly on high, determined to be dignified in spite of
his misfortunes, and advanced two steps into the room without a
remark, as though he were able to show that neither red plush nor
black cloth could disarrange the equal poise of his mighty
mind!</p>
<p>And after all what are a man&rsquo;s garments but the outward
husks in which the fruit is kept, duly tempered from the
wind?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The rank is but the guinea stamp,<br />
The man&rsquo;s the gowd for a&rsquo; that.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And is not the tailor&rsquo;s art as little worthy, as
insignificant as that of the king who makes</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A marquis, duke, and a&rsquo;
that&rdquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who would be content to think that his manly dignity depended
on his coat and waistcoat, or his hold on the world&rsquo;s
esteem on any other garment of usual wear?&nbsp; That no such
weakness soiled his mind Mr. Horne was determined to prove; and
thus he entered the room with measured tread, and stern dignified
demeanour.</p>
<p>Having advanced two steps his eye caught mine.&nbsp; I do not
know whether he was moved by some unconscious smile on my
part;&mdash;for in truth I endeavoured to seem as indifferent as
himself to the nature of his dress;&mdash;or whether he was
invincibly tickled by some inward fancy of his own, but suddenly
his advancing step ceased, a broad flash of comic humour spread
itself over his features, he retreated with his back against the
wall, and then burst out into an immoderate roar of loud
laughter.</p>
<p>And I&mdash;what else could I then do but laugh?&nbsp; He
laughed, and I laughed.&nbsp; He roared, and I roared.&nbsp; He
lifted up his vast legs to view till the rays of the morning sun
shone through the window on the bright hues which he displayed;
and he did not sit down to his breakfast till he had in every
fantastic attitude shown off to the best advantage the red plush
of which he had so recently become proud.</p>
<p>An Antwerp private cabriolet on that day reached the yard of
the H&ocirc;tel de Belle Vue at about 4 p.m., and four waiters,
in a frenzy of astonishment, saw the Reverend Augustus Horne
descend from the vehicle and seek his chamber dressed in the
garments which I have described.&nbsp; But I am inclined to think
that he never again favoured any of his friends with such a
sight.</p>
<p>It was on the next evening after this that I went out to drink
tea with two maiden ladies, relatives of mine, who kept a
seminary for English girls at Brussels.&nbsp; The Misses Macmanus
were very worthy women, and earned their bread in an upright,
painstaking manner.&nbsp; I would not for worlds have passed
through Brussels without paying them this compliment.&nbsp; They
were, however, perhaps a little dull, and I was aware that I
should not probably meet in their drawing-room many of the
fashionable inhabitants of the city.&nbsp; Mr. Horne had declined
to accompany me; but in doing so he was good enough to express a
warm admiration for the character of my worthy cousins.</p>
<p>The elder Miss Macmanus, in her little note, had informed me
that she would have the pleasure of introducing me to a few of my
&ldquo;compatriots.&rdquo;&nbsp; I presumed she meant Englishmen;
and as I was in the habit of meeting such every day of my life at
home, I cannot say that I was peculiarly elevated by the
promise.&nbsp; When, however, I entered the room, there was no
Englishman there;&mdash;there was no man of any kind.&nbsp; There
were twelve ladies collected together with the view of making the
evening pass agreeably to me, the single virile being among them
all.&nbsp; I felt as though I were a sort of Mohammed in
Paradise; but I certainly felt also that the Paradise was none of
my own choosing.</p>
<p>In the centre of the amphitheatre which the ladies formed sat
the two Misses Macmanus;&mdash;there, at least, they sat when
they had completed the process of shaking hands with me.&nbsp; To
the left of them, making one wing of the semicircle, were
arranged the five pupils by attending to whom the Misses Macmanus
earned their living; and the other wing consisted of the five
ladies who had furnished themselves with relics of General
Chass&eacute;.&nbsp; They were my &ldquo;compatriots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was introduced to them all, one after the other; but their
names did not abide in my memory one moment.&nbsp; I was thinking
too much of the singularity of the adventure, and could not
attend to such minuti&aelig;.&nbsp; That the red-rosed harpy was
Miss Grogram, that I remembered;&mdash;that, I may say, I shall
never forget.&nbsp; But whether the motherly lady with the
somewhat blowsy hair was Mrs. Jones, or Mrs. Green, or Mrs.
Walker, I cannot now say.&nbsp; The dumpy female with the broad
back was always called Aunt Sally by the young ladies.</p>
<p>Too much sugar spoils one&rsquo;s tea; I think I have heard
that even prosperity will cloy when it comes in overdoses; and a
schoolboy has been known to be overdone with jam.&nbsp; I myself
have always been peculiarly attached to ladies&rsquo; society,
and have avoided bachelor parties as things execrable in their
very nature.&nbsp; But on this special occasion I felt myself to
be that schoolboy;&mdash;I was literally overdone with jam.&nbsp;
My tea was all sugar, so that I could not drink it.&nbsp; I was
one among twelve.&nbsp; What could I do or say?&nbsp; The
proportion of alloy was too small to have any effect in changing
the nature of the virgin silver, and the conversation became
absolutely feminine.</p>
<p>I must confess also that my previous experience as to these
compatriots of mine had not prejudiced me in their favour.&nbsp;
I regarded them with,&mdash;I am ashamed to say so, seeing that
they were ladies,&mdash;but almost with loathing.&nbsp; When last
I had seen them their occupation had reminded me of some obscene
feast of harpies, or almost of ghouls.&nbsp; They had brought
down to the verge of desperation the man whom of all men I most
venerated.&nbsp; On these accounts I was inclined to be taciturn
with reference to them;&mdash;and then what could I have to say
to the Misses Macmanus&rsquo;s five pupils?</p>
<p>My cousin at first made an effort or two in my favour, but
these efforts were fruitless.&nbsp; I soon died away into utter
unrecognised insignificance, and the conversation, as I have
before said, became feminine.&nbsp; And indeed that horrid Miss
Grogram, who was, as it were, the princess of the ghouls, nearly
monopolised the whole of it.&nbsp; Mamma Jones&mdash;we will call
her Jones for the occasion&mdash;put in a word now and then, as
did also the elder and more energetic Miss Macmanus.&nbsp; The
dumpy lady with the broad back ate tea-cake incessantly; the two
daughters looked scornful, as though they were above their
company with reference to the five pupils; and the five pupils
themselves sat in a row with the utmost propriety, each with her
hands crossed on her lap before her.</p>
<p>Of what they were talking at last I became utterly
oblivious.&nbsp; They had ignored me, going into realms of
muslin, questions of maid-servants, female rights, and cheap
under-clothing; and I therefore had ignored them.&nbsp; My mind
had gone back to Mr. Horne and his garments.&nbsp; While they
spoke of their rights, I was thinking of his wrongs; when they
mentioned the price of flannel, I thought of that of
broadcloth.</p>
<p>But of a sudden my attention was arrested.&nbsp; Miss Macmanus
had said something of the black silks of Antwerp, when Miss
Grogram replied that she had just returned from that city and had
there enjoyed a great success.&nbsp; My cousin had again asked
something about the black silks, thinking, no doubt, that Miss
Grogram had achieved some bargain, but that lady had soon
undeceived her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Miss Grogram, &ldquo;it was at the
castle.&nbsp; We got such beautiful relics of General
Chass&eacute;!&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t we, Mrs. Jones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed we did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jones, bringing out
from beneath the skirts of her dress and ostensibly displaying a
large black bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got such a beautiful needle-case,&rdquo;
said the broad-back, displaying her prize.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been making it up all the morning.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And she handed over the article to Miss Macmanus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And only look at this duck of a pen-wiper,&rdquo;
simpered flaxen-hair No. 2.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only think of wiping
one&rsquo;s pens with relics of General Chass&eacute;!&rdquo; and
she handed it over to the other Miss Macmanus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine&rsquo;s a pin-cushion,&rdquo; said No. 1,
exhibiting the trophy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s nothing to what I&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo;
said Miss Grogram.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the first place, there&rsquo;s
a pair of slippers,&mdash;a beautiful pair;&mdash;they&rsquo;re
not made up yet, of course; and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Misses Macmanus and their five pupils were sitting
open-eared, open-eyed, and open-mouthed.&nbsp; How all these
sombre-looking articles could be relics of General Chass&eacute;
did not at first appear clear to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they, Miss Grogram?&rdquo; said the elder Miss
Macmanus, holding the needle-case in one hand and Mrs.
Jones&rsquo;s bag in the other.&nbsp; Miss Macmanus was a
strong-minded female, and I reverenced my cousin when I saw the
decided way in which she intended to put down the greedy
arrogance of Miss Grogram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are relics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where do they come from, Miss Grogram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, from the castle, to be sure;&mdash;from General
Chass&eacute;&rsquo;s own rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did anybody sell them to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or give them to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no;&mdash;at least not exactly give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they were, and she took &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said
the broad-back.&nbsp; Oh, what a look Miss Grogram gave
her!&nbsp; &ldquo;Took them! of course I took them.&nbsp; That
is, you took them as much as I did.&nbsp; They were things that
we found lying about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What things?&rdquo; asked Miss Macmanus, in a
peculiarly strong-minded tone.</p>
<p>Miss Grogram seemed to be for a moment silenced.&nbsp; I had
been ignored, as I have said, and my existence forgotten; but now
I observed that the eyes of the culprits were turned towards
me,&mdash;the eyes, that is, of four of them.&nbsp; Mrs. Jones
looked at me from beneath her fan; the two girls glanced at me
furtively, and then their eyes fell to the lowest flounces of
their frocks.</p>
<p>Miss Grogram turned her spectacles right upon me, and I
fancied that she nodded her head at me as a sort of answer to
Miss Macmanus.&nbsp; The five pupils opened their mouths and eyes
wider; but she of the broad back was nothing abashed.&nbsp; It
would have been nothing to her had there been a dozen gentlemen
in the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;We just found a pair of
black&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole truth was told in the
plainest possible language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Sally!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Aunt Sally, how can
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold your tongue, Aunt Sally!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then Miss Grogram just cut them up with her
scissors,&rdquo; continued Aunt Sally, not a whit abashed,
&ldquo;and gave us each a bit, only she took more than half for
herself.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was clear to me that there had been some
quarrel, some delicious quarrel, between Aunt Sally and Miss
Grogram.&nbsp; Through the whole adventure I had rather respected
Aunt Sally.&nbsp; &ldquo;She took more than half for
herself,&rdquo; continued Aunt Sally.&nbsp; &ldquo;She kept all
the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jemima,&rdquo; said the elder Miss Macmanus,
interrupting the speaker and addressing her sister, &ldquo;it is
time, I think, for the young ladies to retire.&nbsp; Will you be
kind enough to see them to their rooms?&rdquo;&nbsp; The five
pupils thereupon rose from their seats&mdash;and
courtesied.&nbsp; They then left the room in file, the younger
Miss Macmanus showing them the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t done any harm, have we?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Jones, with some tremulousness in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Miss
Macmanus.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m thinking of now is
this;&mdash;to whom, I wonder, did the garments properly
belong?&nbsp; Who had been the owner and wearer of
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, General Chass&eacute; of course,&rdquo; said Miss
Grogram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were the general&rsquo;s,&rdquo; repeated the two
young ladies; blushing, however, as they alluded to the
subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we thought they were the general&rsquo;s,
certainly; and a very excellent article they were,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they were the butler&rsquo;s?&rdquo; said Aunt
Sally.&nbsp; I certainly had not given her credit for so much
sarcasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Butler&rsquo;s!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Grogram, with a
toss of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Sally, Aunt Sally! how can you?&rdquo;
shrieked the two young ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh laws!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that they could have belonged to
the butler,&rdquo; said Miss Macmanus, with much authority,
&ldquo;seeing that domestics in this country are never clad in
garments of that description; so far my own observation enables
me to speak with certainty.&nbsp; But it is equally sure that
they were never the property of the general lately in command at
Antwerp.&nbsp; Generals, when they are in full dress, wear
ornamental lace upon their&mdash;their regimentals; and
when&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; So much she said, and something more,
which it may be unnecessary that I should repeat; but such were
her eloquence and logic that no doubt would have been left on the
mind of any impartial hearer.&nbsp; If an argumentative speaker
ever proved anything, Miss Macmanus proved that General
Chass&eacute; had never been the wearer of the article in
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know very well they were his!&rdquo; said Miss
Grogram, who was not an impartial hearer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course
they were; whose else&rsquo;s should they be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope they were his,&rdquo; said one of
the young ladies, almost crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d never taken it,&rdquo; said the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear, dear!&rdquo; said Mrs. Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you my needle-case, Miss
Grogram,&rdquo; said Aunt Sally.</p>
<p>I had sat hitherto silent during the whole scene, meditating
how best I might confound the red-nosed harpy.&nbsp; Now, I
thought, was the time for me to strike in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really think, ladies, that there has been some
mistake,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been no mistake at all, sir!&rdquo; said Miss
Grogram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; I answered, very mildly;
&ldquo;very likely not.&nbsp; But some affair of a similar nature
was very much talked about in Antwerp yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh laws!&rdquo; again ejaculated Mrs. Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The affair I allude to has been talked about a good
deal, certainly,&rdquo; I continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;But perhaps it
may be altogether a different circumstance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may be the circumstance to which you
allude?&rdquo; asked Miss Macmanus, in the same authoritative
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it has nothing to do with these
ladies,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but an article of dress, of the
nature they have described, was cut up in the Castle of Antwerp
on the day before yesterday.&nbsp; It belonged to a gentleman who
was visiting the place; and I was given to understand that he is
determined to punish the people who have wronged him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be the same,&rdquo; said Miss Grogram;
but I could see that she was trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh laws! what will become of us?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can all prove that I didn&rsquo;t touch them, and
that I warned her not,&rdquo; said Aunt Sally.&nbsp; In the mean
time the two young ladies had almost fainted behind their
fans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how had it come to pass,&rdquo; asked Miss
Macmanus, &ldquo;that the gentleman had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing more about it, cousin,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;only it does seem that there is an odd
coincidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately after this I took my leave.&nbsp; I saw that I had
avenged my friend, and spread dismay in the hearts of these who
had injured him.&nbsp; I had learned in the course of the evening
at what hotel the five ladies were staying; and in the course of
the next morning I sauntered into the hall, and finding one of
the porters alone, asked if they were still there.&nbsp; The man
told me that they had started by the earliest diligence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you are a friend of theirs,
perhaps you will take charge of these things, which they have
left behind them?&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, he pointed to a table
at the back of the hall, on which were lying the black bag, the
black needle-case, the black pin cushion, and the black
pen-wiper.&nbsp; There was also a heap of fragments of cloth
which I well knew had been intended by Miss Grogram for the
comfort of her feet and ancles.</p>
<p>I declined the commission, however.&nbsp; &ldquo;They were no
special friends of mine,&rdquo; I said; and I left all the relics
still lying on the little table in the back hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the whole, I am satisfied!&rdquo; said the Rev.
Augustus Horne, when I told him the finale of the story.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
